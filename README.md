# Predicting Nvidia Stock Prices with LSTM, Simple RNN, and GRU

This project aims to compare the efficiency of three different types of neural networks - LSTM, Simple RNN, and GRU - in predicting Nvidia stock prices. The data used for training and testing the models is the historical stock price data of Nvidia from January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2022.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the historical stock price data of Nvidia obtained from yfinance library. The dataset includes the following columns:

- Date: The date of the stock price data point.
- Open: The opening price of Nvidia stock on that day.
- High: The highest price of Nvidia stock on that day.
- Low: The lowest price of Nvidia stock on that day.
- Close: The closing price of Nvidia stock on that day.
- Volume: The trading volume of Nvidia stock on that day.
- Adj Close: The adjusted closing price of Nvidia stock on that day.

## Project Structure

You can find all the code and results in the Recurrent Neural Networks to Predict Stock Prices.ipynb file.

## Results
The evaluation results and comparisons of the LSTM, Simple RNN, and GRU models can be found in the Recurrent Neural Networks to Predict Stock Prices.ipynb notebook. The metric used for evaluation is mean squared error (MSE). The notebook provides visualizations of the predicted stock prices and actual prices for each model.

## Conclusion
Based on the evaluation results, the efficiency of the LSTM, Simple RNN, and GRU models in predicting Nvidia stock prices can be compared. The model with the lowest MSE value can be considered the most accurate for predicting Nvidia stock prices.

For further details, please refer to the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks directory.

Feel free to explore and experiment with different models and parameters to enhance the predictions.
